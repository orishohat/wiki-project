  <h2>Apple</h2>
  
  <p>
    Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, software and online services.
    Apple is the largest information technology company by revenue, totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of January 2021, it is the world's most valuable company,
    the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies,
    alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
    It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial success.
    The company went onto develop new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. By 1985,
    the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.
    As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as "Wintel").
    In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics
    including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons,
    and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
   Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2 trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022. The company sometimes receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors,
   its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty, and is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.

  <h3 id="history"> History</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1976-1980: Founding and incorporation</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business partnership.
    The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.
    To finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Bus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500
    (equivalent to $2,274 in 2020).[13] Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.
    The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.
    It went on sale soon after debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,032 in 2020).
    Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".
    Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded Apple.
    Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of US$250,000 (equivalent to $1,067,683 in 2020) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.
    During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.
    The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture.
    While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1/4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.
    The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979. VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an
    additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy. By the end of the 1970s, Apple had become the leading computer manufacturer in the United States.
    On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.39 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of March 30, 2019), generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.
    By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share and a market cap of $1.778 billion.

    <li>1980-1990: Success with Macintosh</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin,
    visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC
    facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[39] shares (5.6 million split-adjusted shares as of March 30, 2019) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share. After the demonstration,
    Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.
    The Lisa division would be plagued by infighting, and in 1982 Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI,
    but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software titles.
    Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as low-cost-computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II,
    but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.
    Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.

  <ul>
    <li>1990–1997: Decline and restructuring</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.
    In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system,
    adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.
    The success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue. For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process.
    The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.
    The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of their higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands,
    selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra models, the mid-range Centris line, and the consumer-marketed Performa series.
    This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.
    The early 1990s also saw the discontinuation of the Apple II series, which was expensive to produce, and the company felt was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models.
    After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II.
    The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.

  <ul>
    <li>1997–2007: Return to profitability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997, and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a
    three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.
    The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.
    The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.
    The investment was seen as an "antitrust insurance policy" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices. Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.
    On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.
    The moves paid off for Jobs, at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.

  <ul>
    <li>2007–2011: Success with mobile devices</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as "Apple Inc.",
    because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics. This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone
    and the Apple TV. The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales, and the device was called "a game changer for the industry".
    In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM) ,
    thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology. On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal
    of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007. Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009
    to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.

  </ul>
  <p>
    Macintosh, commonly known as Mac, is Apple's line of personal computers that use the company's proprietary macOS operating system.
    Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2021 they account for only about 10 percent of the company's revenue.
    The company is in the process of switching Mac computers from Intel processors to Apple silicon, a custom-designed system on a chip platform.
    As of March 2022, there are six Macintosh computer families in production:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" target="_blank"> iMac </a>: Consumer all-in-one desktop computer, introduced in 1998.</li>

    <li>iPhone</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones that use the company's proprietary iOS operating system, derived from macOS.
    The first-generation iPhone was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then,
    Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates.
    The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen, which at the time of its introduction was described
    as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with popularizing 
    the smartphone and slate form factor, and with creating a large market for smartphone apps, or "app economy".
    iOS is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android. The iPhone has generated large profits for the company,
    and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.
    As of the end of 2021, the iPhone accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.
    As of January 2022, 33 iPhone models have been produced, with five smartphone families in production:
    
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13" target="_blank"> iPhone 13 </a></li>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13_Pro" target="_blank"> iPhone 13 Pro </a></li>

  <ul>
    <li>iPad</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    iPad is Apple's line of tablet computers that use the company's proprietary iPadOS operating system, derived from macOS and iOS.
    The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010.
    The iPad took the multi-touch user interface first introduced in the iPhone, and adapted it to a larger screen,
    marked for interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, books, photos, videos, music, documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps.
    Earlier generations of the iPad used the same iOS operating system as the company's smartphones before being split off in 2019.
    As of September 2020, Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.
    However, the iPad remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020,
    and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021.
    In recent years, Apple has started offering more powerful versions of the device, with the current iPad Pro sharing the same Apple silicon as Macintosh computers,
    along with a smaller version of the device called iPad mini, and an upgraded version called iPad Air.
    As of January 2022, there are four iPad families in production:
    
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(9th_generation)" target="_blank"> iPad (9th generation) </a></li>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini_(6th_generation)" target="_blank"> iPad mini (6th generation) </a></li>

    <ul>
      <li>LOGO</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".
    Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's "rainbow Apple",
    the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo,
    and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company. The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.
    The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color. 
    This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide. Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.
    On August 27, 1999 (the year following the introduction of the iMac G3), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.
    An Aqua-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1998 to 2003, and a glass-themed version was used from 2007 to 2013.

  <ul>
    <li>Advertising</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Apple's first slogan, "Byte into an Apple", was coined in the late 1970s. 
  From 1997 to 2002, the slogan "Think Different" was used in advertising campaigns,
  and is still closely associated with Apple. Apple also has slogans for specific product lines — for example,
  "iThink, therefore iMac" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,
  and "Say hello to iPhone" has been used in iPhone advertisements.
  "Hello" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac ("hello (again)"), and iPod.
  From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts,
  Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products.
  However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[230] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.
  Apple's product advertisements gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.
  Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements
  include Canadian singer Feist with the song "1234" and Yael Naïm with the song "New Soul".
</p>


<ul>
  <li>Brand loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history. In 1984, BYTE stated that:
  There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause;
  and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right.
  Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.
  Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth,
  Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations,
  to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation
  exemplifies the American Dream. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.
